-Optionals
// for situations where a value might be or not be present

// example
let simpleString = "0506"
let anotherString = "Hello World"

let number = Int(simpleString) // number is 0506
let anotherNumber = Int(anotherString) // anotherNumber will be nil because 'Hello World' cannot be converted to int

// Int() initializer might have the correct or incorrect value to be inserted into number variables
// so the initializer has been defined to return an optional value ? in case the value is nil

// if we want to have a variable or a constant that might be nil, we have to define it as optional

// if var/constant is defined without a default value, it automatically gets set to nil
let convertedNumber: Int? 
NOTE: In Swift nil is not the same nil as Objc. In Objc nil is a pointer to a non-existant object, in Swift it is the absence of a value of certain type.
