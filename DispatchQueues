Dispatch Queues in Swift 3.0

// new syntax for creating dispatch queues
let queue = DispatchQueue(label:"com.eejahromi.queue")

-synchronous queue
queue.sync{
  for i in 20 {
    print(i)
  }
}
// this code will not execute until the code above (synchronous queue) is finished
// NOTE: this print statement will be executed on the main queue
print("this comes after the synchronous queue")


-asynchronous queue
queue.async{
  for i in 20 {
    print(i)
  }
}

for i in 30..<40 {
  print(i)
}

// Explanation: Since "queue" is asynchronous, the above code will be executed in parallel
// the code that's executing on the main queue has higher priority so most likely it will finish before the asynchronous queue
