-Protocol Oriented Programming
we know we can use extensions to add more functionality to any type in swift. including ones we haven't written ourselves.
//Protocol Extension Example
protocol TeamRecord {
  var wins: Int { get }
  var losses: Int { get }
  func winningPercentage() -> Double
}

extension TeamRecord {
  var gamesPlayed: Int {
    return wins + losses
  }
}

// in this case the compiler knows any type that conforms to TeamRecord will have all the members of TeamRecord
// also in TeamRecord protocol we have declarations only but in extension we have the implementation of the member
