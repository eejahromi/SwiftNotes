Attributes in classes and structs that need to have memory allocated for them are called strored properties.
If attributes are calculated on the fly with no memory allocation, they're called computed peoperties.

struct TV{
  var height; Double
  var width: Double
  
  // computed property 
  // should be a var 
  // should have a return value and uses curly braces to contain the code
  var diagonal: Int{
    // calculate diagonal
    return Int(diagonalDimension)
  }
}

-getters and setters
// we cuold also explicitly use getters and setters 
var diagonal: Int{
  get{
    return Int(calculatedDiagonalDimension)
  }
  
  set{
    width = ...
    height = ...
  }
}

tv.diagonal = 70
let height = tv.height
let width = tv.width
