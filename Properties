Attributes in classes and structs that need to have memory allocated for them are called strored properties.
If attributes are calculated on the fly with no memory allocation, they're called computed peoperties.

struct TV{
  var height; Double
  var width: Double
  
  var diagonal: Int{
    // calculate diagonal
    return Int(diagonalDimension)
  }
}
