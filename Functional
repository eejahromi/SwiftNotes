Higher-order-function: Any function that takes in another function as a parameter.
The big three: Map, Reduce, Filter

-Map
//In swift map is not defined as a function but as a method...
let upperCaseAnimals = animals.map(capitalize)

// also it isn't defined on Array<T> but defined in the sequenceType protocol

-In functional programming, the idea is to avoid external state and to have functions give you the same result for the same input.

Best practices:
-prefer immutable values (constants instead of variables).
-use pure functions (function that does not modify the input).
-treat functions as values (pass functions as parameters).
